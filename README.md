Cyclistic Trip Data  Analysis

This is a project I completed using the R language in R Studio. 

The  packages utilised include  tidyverse, readr, ggplot2, lubridate and dplyr. 

I imported, cleaned and analysed the data, before visualising it in R. I then expoted my aggregations as CSVs from R Studio, before upoading them into Tableau for more advanced visualisations.
